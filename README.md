Two simulation cases:

1. Coarse GPU simulation mesh with particles, running with NVHPC compiler maia version on branch https://git.rwth-aachen.de/aia/MAIA/Solver/-/commits/master-fzj-gpu

2. Proper level of refinement CPU simulation, that has alread been running with GNU version of maia at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/aia/MAIA/Solver/-/tree/nasal-cavity?ref_type=heads
